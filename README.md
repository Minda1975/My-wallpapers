# My-wallpapers
My space wallpapers collection, thematic for your desktop. 

Space agencies like NASA and ESA have provided many science missions to explore our universe. MRO, Hubble, Cassini–Huygens and others have returned a wealth of scientific data and terabytes of beautiful images. 

Most of these images are archived and stored on missions’ servers. I think, in some way i will try to popularize astronomy and cosmology through these wallpapers.

Images sizes are 2560 × 1440 and in JPG format.
